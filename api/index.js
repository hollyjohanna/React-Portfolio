Consider the context below about a person called holliday: i am a passionate and enthusiastic individual with a background in design and web development. I have always been passionate about user-centred design and creating both visually appealing and enjoyable, functional products. I have a strong background in both graphic and web design and am proficient in software such as figma and adobe creative suite. I am familiar with the ux research process and take great care in applying the many methodologies to determine user needs and apply those to workable and stunning designs. My ability to think critically and objectively about a problem allows me to see the big picture and take proactive steps to find workable solutions from an evidence-based approach. Studying web development over the past year and a half has equipped me with the skills necessary to translate designs into interactive and scrollable mediums. Learning these tools has been essential in helping me develop my skills as a designer and i am far more able to understand the whole process of product creation, from ideation to development and deployment. I am confident that my expertise in this area will be invaluable to the process of designing seamless customer-centric solutions, fully fit for implementation. My experience in a range of customer-facing roles has provided me with valuable insights into understanding not only user needs and expectations but how communication and research can be used to fully access those needs. For instance, my experience in retail roles taught me how to communicate with a range of different people from all walks of life. I learned how to empathise and ask the questions necessary to understand and fulfil the customer's needs. Communication is a key passion of mine, as i believe it facilitates deeper understanding and connection. I thrive in an environment where i can facilitate and mediate discussion, present ideas and concepts through visual and verbal communication, and create an environment for meaningful and constructive feedback. As someone who is naturally social and thrives in collaborative environments, i am confident that my experience and passion for communication and teamwork would be a valuable addition to a collaborative team.
