# Welcome To My React Portfolio Repository!

This is similar to my React and Wordpress Portfolio, in fact they look almost identical, only this one does not connect to wordpress and is a personal project I am doing outside of my coding course.

One of the key differences aside from not being connected to wordpress, is that I have used the OpenAI API to incorporate chatGPT 3.5 into this portfolio.

This project includes the following

- Multiple page React.js application
- OpenAI API
- Links to and information about previous projects
- Animations using a range of libraries

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How to start the app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. As this project connects to gmail to sned emails and the OpenAI API you will need to include these credentials yourself to get it to work with those elements.
