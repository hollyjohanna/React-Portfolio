Consider the context below about a person called ‘Holliday’: 

As a passionate and enthusiastic individual with a background in design and web development, I am excited about the opportunity to use these skills and work for an organization that aligns with my values of the safety and well-being of New Zealand's community. I have always been passionate about user-centred design and creating both visually appealing and enjoyable, functional products. I have a strong background in both graphic and web design and am proficient in software such as Figma and Adobe Creative Suite. I am familiar with the UX research process and take great care in applying the many methodologies to determine user needs and apply those to workable and stunning designs. My ability to think critically and objectively about a problem allows me to see the big picture and take proactive steps to find workable solutions from an evidence-based approach. Studying web development over the past year has equipped me with the skills necessary to translate designs into interactive and scrollable mediums. Learning these tools has been essential in helping me develop my skills as a designer and I am far more able to understand the whole process of product creation, from ideation to development and deployment. I am confident that my expertise in this area will be invaluable to the process of designing seamless customer-centric solutions, fully fit for implementation. My experience in a range of customer-facing roles has provided me with valuable insights into understanding not only user needs and expectations but how communication and research can be used to fully access those needs. For instance, my experience in retail roles taught me how to communicate with a range of different people from all walks of life. I learned how to empathise and ask the questions necessary to understand and fulfil the customer's needs. Communication is a key passion of mine, as I believe it facilitates deeper understanding and connection. I thrive in an environment where I can facilitate and mediate discussion, present ideas and concepts through visual and verbal communication, and create an environment for meaningful and constructive feedback. As someone who is naturally social and thrives in collaborative environments, I am confident that my experience and passion for communication and teamwork would be a valuable addition to a collaborative team.

SKILLS SUMMARY

PROBLEM SOLVING
I am a deeply logical and creative thinker. When I encounter a problem that needs to be solved I really enjoy going through the process of organising all possible solutions and finding the best outcome. My problem-solving abilities have helped me succeed in both an academic setting and in the workplace.  During my work at NZCER I was able to identify issues that arose with the processes in gathering resources, create a more streamlined solution and implement the solution by creating a filterable database of resources to be used in ongoing projects.

USER EXPERIENCE
I have been interested in design my whole life and have a keen eye for details that work best for the user. I find myself constantly interacting with websites that I believe could be improved significantly to better fit the needs of the user and as such am extremely interested in opportunities to do this as a career. In my roles at Kilt and NZCER, I improved many processes in the businesses that were tricky to navigate to make it a more seamless experience for everyone involved including organising and streamlining the recruitment process at KILT and creating a more streamlined database of resources at NZCER.

PLANNING AND ORGANISING
My structural thinking makes me great at planning and organising. I have a passion for creating detailed plans and keeping documentation of all processes I am involved in. While working as the store manager of Kilt Clothing I had to manage several different procedures and processes at once while keeping to strict deadlines. This helped me further develop my organizational skills to the point where I was able to plan each step of a project or process and keep on top of deadlines to deliver a high-quality result.

SELF DEVELOPMENT
I am extremely focused on ongoing self-development and finding the knowledge and skills to tackle new problems and projects. I have sought out extra programmes during my studies in Web/UX design at Yoobee to help me improve my coding ability as well as my design eye. I find it extremely rewarding to continue to learn via personal research and find resources to improve and develop further.

COMMUNICATION SKILLS
One of my greatest skills is my ability to communicate effectively and clearly. As communication is a passion of mine I pride myself in having a clear and concise method which has helped me in interpersonal relationships in the workplace and in my personal life. I really enjoy liaising with people, being able to mediate disputes and being the voice of a group of people.  I was class representative of two classes at Victoria University, and am currently the class representative at Yoobee. My work as manager of Kilt Clothing Wellington helped me expand my communication skills. It was my role to manage a team of employees and make sure I was encouraging and supportive, as well as constructive and organised.
