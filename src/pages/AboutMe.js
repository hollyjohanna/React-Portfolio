        <p>
          I've been a web developer and UX designer since the beginning of 2022
          when I started my diploma in Web/UX design and since then have become
          obsessed with coding awesome fun sites that are fully desiged by me!
        </p>
        <p>
          I have since become a skilled designer and a passionate developer,
          creating fun little websites in my spare time and continuing to learn
          and extend my knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before Web and UX design I spent most of my time creating art, I love
          painting, drawing, crafting and creating and I have always been a very
          logical and precise artist so Web Development fits me well!

          Apart from art, I love a great many different hobbies, I like to play
          music, mostly on my ukulele, I enjoy roller skating, surfing, sewing
          clothes and being social.

        <p>Also I'm obsessed with unicorns!</p>
