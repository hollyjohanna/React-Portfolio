          <p>
            Iâ€™ve been a web developer and UX designer since the beginning of
            2022 when I started my diploma in Web/UX design and since then have
            become obsessed with coding awesome fun sites that are fully
            designed by me!
          </p>
          <p>
            I have since become a skilled designer and a passionate developer,
            creating fun little websites in my spare time and continuing to
            learn and extend my knowledge.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before Web and UX design I spent most of my time creating art, I
            love painting, drawing, crafting and creating and I have always been
            a very logical and precise artist so Web Development fits me well!
